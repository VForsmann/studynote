= Studynote

This is a small template so create studynotes.
You have to write in asciidoc and will get a nice formatted PDF.

But there are some things to do first:

```
npm i -g @asciidoctor/core asciidoctor-pdf
```

Check the version:

```
asciidoctor-pdf --version
```

Its important that it shows *asciidoctor-web-pdf*:

```
Asciidoctor Web PDF 1.0.0-alpha.9 using Asciidoctor.js 2.2.0 (Asciidoctor 2.0.10) [https://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (node v12.18.2 on darwin)
CLI version 3.4.0
```

To use this template as custom layout, create a file next to the studynote-repo like example.adoc:

```
= Example Document
Vitus Forsmann
:github: https://www.github.com/VForsmann/
:studiengang: IT
:hochschule: MIT
:semester: 8
:hochschul_logo: logo.svg
:imagesdir: images

:ebene1: This is the main-heading for Page 1
:ebene2: This is the secondary-heading for Page 1
:ebene3: This ist the third-heading for Page 1
== NewPage

You have to set ebene1, ebene2 and ebene3 infront of every new page!

=== This is a designed Block

All content here is inside that Block.

Right now you have to care manually about pages, there is not automatic creation of new pages when the content overflows.

All other stuff works like normal asciidoc.

```

Then run asciidoctor-pdf like this:

```
asciidoctor-pdf ./example.adoc --template-require ./studynote/template.js
```
